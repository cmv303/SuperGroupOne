# LyricAlly
Welcome to LyricAlly! Have you ever sung a tune you only knew one line of and couldn't get it out of your head, but also couldn't listen to it because you couldn't remember what song it belonged to? Well, LyricAlly is here to help!

Just type in your lyrics, or filter by track name if that is what you know. You also have the option to search only by lyrics or search for the video associated with the song.

This is only the start of what will surely scratch that itch when Shazam thinks you're too off pitch to know what the heck you're talking about.
Get your LyricAlly going!
